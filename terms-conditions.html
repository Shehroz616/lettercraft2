                    1. The Client may, without cause, terminate a Contract (or, subject to this clause 10.1,
                    part of a
                    Contract) at any time up until 30 minutes after first payment in respect of that Contract has been
                    received
                    by Letter Crafts, by giving written notification to Letter Crafts within that 30 minute time period.
                    The

                    clause,
                    the Client must, at the time of giving notice of termination, specify the Services that are no

                    required.<br>
                    2. Without limiting any other rights or remedies that Letter Crafts may have, Letter Crafts
                    may
                    terminate the Contract on written notice to the Client if the Client fails to pay any overdue amount

                    five days following written notice from Letter Crafts requiring payment.<br>

                    Crafts’s
                    rights under clause 10.2, either party may terminate the Contract immediately if the other
                    party:<br>

                    a. breaches
                    any of its obligations under the Contract and fails to remedy the breach within 20 days of receiving
                    notice

                    creditors.<br>
                    4. On termination of a Contract:<br>
